1. make parser able to read in the sections of our structured job description pdfs

2. 
- (slowest great) compare the similarity of corresponding sections in a resume and the job description 
   (experience + projects vs responsibilities etc)     
- (fastest ok) compare similarity by vectorizing resume and job and using cosine similarity
- (fastestest ?) look into keyterm extraction and how it could be used to compare similarity
- (faster good) static embeddings? train on resume dataset, vectorize, and compare cosine similarity?
